To get a sense for the Titanic data set, we are going to do some exploratory 
data analysis. As part of that, we will use the `xray` package to check 
for anomalies and look at distributions.

```{r setup, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(xray)
```

## Data Import

First, we need to import the training and testing data.

```{r, message = FALSE}
training <- read_csv("train.csv", progress = FALSE)
testing <- read_csv("test.csv", progress = FALSE)
```

Now, let's want to take a look at the data.

```{r}
training
```
