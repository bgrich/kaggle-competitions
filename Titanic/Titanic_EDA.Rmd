To get a sense for the Titanic data set, we are going to do some exploratory 
data analysis. As part of that, we will use the `xray` package to check 
for anomalies and look at distributions.

```{r setup, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(xray)
library(knitr)
```

## Data Import

First, we need to import the training and testing data.

```{r, message = FALSE}
training <- read_csv("train.csv", progress = FALSE)
testing <- read_csv("test.csv", progress = FALSE)
```

Now, let's take a look at the data.

```{r}
training
```

We can also use `glimpse` to take a look at the variables. 

```{r}
glimpse(training)
```

We have 12 variables that we will want to look at. According to the data set 
description from Kaggle, the variables are defined in the following way: 

* PassengerId -- A numerical id for each passenger.
* Survived -- The response variable as a factor showing survival.
* Pclass -- The ticket class of the passenger used as a proxy for socio-economic 
class. This variable is a factor with levels 1 = 1st (Upper Class), 
2 = 2nd (Middle Class), and 3 = 3rd (Lower Class).
* Name -- The full name of the passenger with title. Married female passengers 
appear to have their partner's name listed with their actual name in 
parentheses.
* Sex -- A factor showing the sex of the passenger.
* Age -- The age of the passenger. Estimated ages are given as xx.#. 
* SibSp -- The number of siblings and spouses the passnger has aboard. 
* Parch -- The number of parent/children relationships that the passneger has 
aboard.
* Ticket -- Ticket number of the passenger.
* Fare -- The passenger fare. 
* Cabin -- The passenge cabin number. 
* Embarked -- The port of embarkation. This is a factor with three levels 
C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton.

Before we begin the exploration, let's recode the factors with proper levels. 

```{r}
training <- training %>% 
  mutate(Survived = factor(Survived, 
                           levels = c(1, 0), 
                           labels = c("Yes", "No"))) %>% 
  mutate(Pclass = factor(Pclass, 
                         levels = c(3, 2, 1), 
                         labels = c("3rd", "2nd", "1st"), 
                         ordered = TRUE)) %>% 
  mutate(Sex = factor(Sex, 
                      levels = c("male", "female"))) %>% 
  mutate(Embarked = factor(Embarked, 
                           levels = c("C", "Q", "S"), 
                           labels = c("Cherbourg", "Queenstown", "Southampton")))
```

```{r}
testing <- testing %>% 
  mutate(Pclass = factor(Pclass, 
                         levels = c(3, 2, 1), 
                         labels = c("3rd", "2nd", "1st"), 
                         ordered = TRUE)) %>% 
  mutate(Sex = factor(Sex, 
                      levels = c("male", "female"))) %>% 
  mutate(Embarked = factor(Embarked, 
                           levels = c("C", "Q", "S"), 
                           labels = c("Cherbourg", "Queenstown", "Southampton")))
```

## Exploration with `xray`

### Checking Anomalies with `xray`

Now that the data sets have been re-coded with factors, let's take a look for 
any anomalies in the data set using the `xray` package. The `xray` package 
gives access to several functions for performing exploratory data analysis. 
The first one we will use is the `anomalies()` function that returns a data 
frame summarizing the variables in a provided data frame. 

The function returns summaries for each variable showing:

* The number of observations
* The number and percentage of observations that are NA
* The number and percentage of observations that are zero
* The number and percentage of observations that are blank
* The number and percentage of observations that are infinite
* The number of distinct observations
* The variable type 
* The percentage of observations that are "anomalous"

This information can give us a starting point to examine the data set and see 
what variables will be useful for training our models.

```{r xray_anomalies, results = 'asis'}
xray::anomalies(training)$variables %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

From calculating the anomalies on the training data, we can see that most of 
the entries in the Cabin variable are NA. There are two options with this 
entry as we can either remove the Cabin variable entirely or recode all of the 
NA's as "No Cabin" or some similar value. We will investigate the other two 
variables with NA's below to see if we can turn them into something useful.

There are also three variables that show a number of zero observations. For the 
Parch and SibSp variables, this should be fine. This just means that those 
passengers are traveling without family members. For the fare, we may want to 
investigate which of the passengers have zero fare as they may be crew members 
or have some other identifying information.

One interesting point that pops out from the anomalies function is that the 
Ticket variable has only 681 distinct observations. This means that there must 
be a few repeat tickets that bears a quick investigation.

Note: As of this writing, the `xray` does not currently support ordered factors. 
This is why the `Pclass` variable has a class of "Unknown" from the anomalies() 
function. This will also cause a problem with the distributions() function so 
we will remove the ordering for that.

### Distributions with `xray`

Next, we will use the `distributions()` function from the `xray` package to 
visually inspect the variables. This function returns a series of box plots 
(for categorical variables) and histograms (for numerical variables) along 
with giving some distributions and breakdowns for the numerical variables. 

For the bar plots, the axis labeled as "Rows" is actually the number of 
observations of each variable category. For the histograms, the number of 
observations has been scaled for the associated density plot.

```{r, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 9}
training %>% 
  select(-PassengerId, -Name) %>% 
  mutate(Pclass = factor(Pclass, ordered = FALSE)) %>% 
  xray::distributions()
```

The `distributions()` function gives us a very rough visual tool for inspecting 
the variables. The function allows us to see some general trends and places 
that could use further checking. For instance, with this data set, it is clear 
that the fare is being skewed by large outliers. Both the cabin and ticket 
variables have many categories with low counts that make them hard to visualize 
with a bar plot. However, the `distributions()` function works great for the 
other variables as a means of quick visual analysis.

## Further Exploration

The `xray` package has given us a good starting point for some further 
analysis. We will want to look closer at the Fare and Age variables as there 
might be further structure hidden due to the outliers and binning choices. We 
also want to inspect the Age variable for the NAs that are present and see if 
we can extract anything useful. We may also want to look at the Ticket variable 
and see if there is a good way to represent the tickets. 

### Fare

If we remove all of the fares above 200 and increase the number of bins to 20, 
we start to see a more structured distribution. We still get a long tail out 
to large fares, but we now have a sharp spike at lower fare values with a small 
pedestal around 20 to 40.

```{r}
training %>% 
  filter(Fare <= 200) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Fare)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, color = "white") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Fare", 
       y = "Observations")
```

### Age

We can examine the Age variable further by reproducing the Age histogram from 
`xray::distributions()`, but increasing the number of bins to 30. From that, 
we see that the ages are distributed with a slight skew to older ages. There is 
also a small drop off in younger passnegers from ages 6 to 14.

```{r}
training %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Age)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Age)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, color = "white") + 
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Age (years old)", 
       y = "Observations")
```

Next, we want to explore whether there is any connection between missing Age 
values and the other variables. Doing a quick visual exploration of the data, 
most of the missing Age values seem to also be missing Cabin values. Looking at 
the names, these appear to be passengers from various age ranges as some of 
the names are women with married names. To further examine, we can use the 
`xray::distributions()` function again on just the Ages with NA's.

```{r}
training %>% 
  filter(is.na(Age)) %>% 
  mutate(Pclass = factor(Pclass, ordered = FALSE)) %>% 
  select(-Age, -PassengerId, -Ticket, -Name, -Cabin) %>% 
  xray::distributions()
```

From these figures, we can see that many of the Age NA's come from lower 
class passengers and that a majority of them were male and did not survive. 
From this, I would say that the observations with Age NA's cannot be ignored. 
To get around this for modeling, we could try binning the ages and including 
a bin that contains all the missing ages. According to the data explanation 
included with this data sets, these missing ages may be estimated ages that 
did not make it into the Kaggle dataset.

### Tickets

Lastly, I want to take a closer look at the tickets. According to the 
`xray::anamolies()` function, there are at least few non-unique tickets. Since 
there are a large number of categories with only a few counts in each, an 
easier way to model these may be to bin the tickets based on their uniqueness, 
i.e., is a particular ticket unique to 1 person, 2 people, 3 people, etc. We 
can examine this by grouping by the Ticket, getting the count per ticket, and 
then creating a contingency table of the number of counts. 

```{r}
training %>% 
  group_by(Ticket) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(-Ticket) %>% 
  table()
```

From the contingency table, we can see that the majority of the tickets are 
unique, with the next highest being unique to two people. For modeling, we will 
likely want to collapse 5, 6, and 7 down to a single category of 5+ due to 
the low counts in those categories.
